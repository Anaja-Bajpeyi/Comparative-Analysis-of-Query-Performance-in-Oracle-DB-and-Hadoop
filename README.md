# Comparative-Analysis-of-Query-Performance-in-Oracle-DB-and-Hadoop

Designed Sales Transaction Management System for creation of simple and complex SQL queries.

Executed all the queries done using oracle db11g to see the performance difference with the queries on the Hadoop cluster where data is stored using Hive QL to see time taken on both databases consisting a dataset of 50 records for 5 tables.

Generated output on variety of queries like aggregates, group by, order by and Joins like self-join, complex join (3-way join, 4- way join) showed that Oracle is highly efficient to work on small datasets and row level DML operations than Hive / Hadoop.
